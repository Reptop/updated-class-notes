  Computer:
    - Always has an operating system
    - Usually has a display and lots of user interaction
    - Designed to be general purpose
    - In general, expensive

  Embedded systems:
    - NO OS
    - Some user input but lots of sensors and data
    - Dedicated purpose
    - in general, inexpensive

  We'll be using arduinos 
    - specifically IDE's and Libraries
    for hardware: we will be using an ESP32
      - This includes wifi and bluetooth
      - has a programmable USB cable

      Back then, all logic was 5 volts but we scaled this down 
      because of high power consumption

      arduino 

      void setup() {
        //init code like vars, structs, and function prototypes
      }

      void loop() {
        //main code
      }

      Serial Communication:
        sending information...

      UART:
        uses 3 wires to connect two devices. For u, these wires are 
        virtual and work over USB

      UART talks at agreed on speeds and styles. This is just like
      talking...
