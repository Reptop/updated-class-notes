  Assumption:
    - Argument is an inherent part of human interaction

  Critical thinking involves seeing all angles of a situation before making judgments (be open minded)
  
  What is an argument?
    people use the concept of arugument in many different ways

    Professor Wayne Brockriede proposed:
      An interferential leap from existing beliefs to the adoption/or reinforcment of a belief

    Fact Claims:

  Direction of change - ---Should---, Will, Must (Advocating a change that is not already occuring)

  ill - the issue at hand
  blame - the cause, who tf is to blame
  cure - what is the solution to the problem 
  cost - what are the solution's drawbacks/cost (what are u losing, what are you gaining)

  Key terms:
    are items in your proposition that you need to define. These are words/phrases/references that may be:
      - Equivocal
      - Ambiguous
      - technical ("Words that someone may not know because they are not chronically online")
      - Coined
      - New

For example, define piracy and media preservation, copyright law, media, preservation


Arguments does not need to be heated, messy, and loud. Or reach a definitive conclusion


Ethics: the moral choices a person makes regarding their behavior
  - Ethics are learned and shared
  - Ethics are driven by values and beliefs 

Four universal standards of ethical argumentation:
  - clarity 
  - honesty 
  - efficiency 
  - respect

  CHER (shere)

  To be credible, you must be ethical 

  - Credibility: How believable you are, or how willing your audience is to believe you 
    - Clarity: includes clear citations or reliable, releveant, current sources
    - honesty: includes thouroughly researching all sidese presenting accurate information
    - efficiency: includes not misleading audiences with inaccurate and/or inadequate information,
                  and avoiding fallacies and unrelated information
    - Reshe advocate has that the claim is true

  rebuttal: is the exception to the truth of the arguers claim

  what is logical 


May 1st 2023:
  Policy deliberataion experience:
    - Works with other students
    - Discusses a policy proposition - students taking different sides of a controversial topic
    - The PDE is not a debate or competition

    - Refuation: seeks to reduce the audience's support for competing claims 

    - Advocacy: Emphasizes advancing your own case, i.e. what you suport your purpose

    Refutation: Involves indicting your opponent's claims, evidence, and 
                reasoning 
                
                Also referred to as burden of clash or burden of rejoiner

    The focus of refuation:
      - Audience-centered 

      - subject centered

      - Speaker advocate centered 

      Refutation and ethics:
        Arguing to make better decisions versus arguing to win 

        Arguing as a way of knowing

        Refutation process: 
          - Listen carefully - in a focused way 
          - Critically evaluate the arguments 
          - Formulate a response 
          - Present that response

          Refutation skills:
             - use active listening
             - raise questions
             - ...
             - ...

          example: you say obamacare is bad but what is your actual proof
                    (Tell me where you're getting your info)

          A good place to refute is to look at the evidence or lack thereof

Monday May 15th 2023:
  We also should be able to evaluate arguments and constructively criticize arguments

  how does fallacies effect the argument as a whole? The audience's perception of the argument?
  
  What is Credibility?
    (How we can evaluate it to scrutinize certain arguments)

  Did the video convice you that portland was weird?
    No it absolutely did not do that
    it also cherry picked evidence - ideally, you're supposed to allow the evidence lead you to the truth
