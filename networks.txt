  power wall:
    single threaded performance is not increasing as much as 
    transistor density
    
    since 2005, frequency has been steady - like there's no 
    10ghz processors

    the 14900k reached like 9ghz I think - still impressive

    He's saying that frequency is not going up but I think it is 
    but just VERY slowly


    the introduction to hyperthreading helped a lot 

    threadripper :0 

    memory wall:  
      cpu/gpu performance increases by a factor of 3 every 2 years
      however, there's a gap between memory speed and peak perforamance

      - The larger the memory capacity is, the more latency in memory 
        the more latency there is. The issue with modern cpus is that 
        they are being starved; the next instruction is not being 
        fetched fast enough because modern cpus are so fast.

      - apple engineers were really smart beacause they prioritized 
        memory bandwith and kept core count the same.

      - Why we dont use gpus to run operating system:
          gpus dont like branching and its highly required to have
          this feature for gpus 

      - point of tensor processing units:
          to point stuff away from the cpu - as this allows to free load on 
          the cpu

      - IEEE and CIPM are not SI units - they are just industry standard

      - 1 byte is always 8 bits

      - ISO/OSI Layer Referene Model will be the map to structure 
        the "stack" of physicial HW/SW

  Chapter 1: Computer Networks:
    
    What is the internet?
      Billions of connected computing devices 

      (Also called the edge of the internet)
      hosts = end systems can also call them clients or severs 
      based on the context
      running network apps at internet's edge

      Packet switches: forward packets (chunks of data)
      - routers, switches

      Communication links:
        fiber, copper, radio, satellite 
        transmission rate: bandwith

      networks:
        collection of devices , routers, 
        links: managed by an organization 

    What are protocols?
    Network edge?
    Network core?
    what exactly is an ip address?


    The internet "network of networks"
    - interconnected ISPs 

    What's a protocol?
      A human protocol and a computer network protocol 

      Human protocol:
        - What's the time?
        - I have a question 
        - introduction 



      computer protocol:

      tcp connection request-> server 

      server responds with tcp connection --> GET url 

      -> returns url 


      Protocols that we will use:
        HTTPS -> get data from web pages 
        DNS = "type a URL name in your browser"
        DHCP = "auto get IP address assigned to your computer"
        NTP = "synchronize time over the network"
        FTP = "file transfer protocol" (old fashion nowadays)
        SMTP = "For sending emails"
        IMAP = "one of the protocols to recieve emails in an email client"
        TETLNET and SSH = "command line to make call to another computer"


      Access networks: cable-based access 
        - ..... 

      Digital suscriber line (DSL)
      - use existing telephone line 

      Access networks: home networks 
        - wireless devices 
        - wifi wireless device 

      wifi access network connects end system to router 
        - via base station aka "access point"

        wireless local area networks:
          .... 

      enterprise networks:
        - companies, universities
        - mix of wired, wireless link technologies, connecting a mix 
          of switches 

        - ethernet
        - ....

      Host: sends packets of data 
        - takes application message 
        - breaks into smaller chunks 
        - known as packets, of length L bits 
        - Transmits packet into access network at 
          transmission rates 
      
      Links: physical media
        - bit propogates between transmitter/reciever pairs 
        - physical links: what lies between transmitter and reciever 
        - guided media:
            - signals propagates in solid 
              media: copper... 

        coaxial cable:
          - bidirectional 
          - two concentric copper conductors 
          - broadband
              - multiple frequency channels on cable 
              - 100s Mbps per channel 

          Fiber optic:
            glass fiber carrying lifht pulses, each pulse a bit 
            high speed operation:
              high speed point-to-point 

            - LOW ERROR RATE
               - but the repair process......... its so meticulous

    - internet structure: a network of networks 

      its a connection of internet service providers 
      interacting with each other 

      At the center: small $ of well-connected large networks 

      content provider networks: ...... 

      ...... 


      make sure to review those blanks after class 


      packet delay: four sources 
        nodal processing      queing delay 

      Caravan analogy: propagation vs. transmission 
      .....

      --- Oregon state's service provider is linkoregon ---

      "Real" internet delays and routes 

      - what do real internet delay & loss look like?
          ....


      we looked at practice questions that I must look at 
      after class - I got the math


      "time of first poacket left" - "time of 2nd packet arrives"


      throughput: rate (bits/time unit) at which bits are being sent from
      sender to reciever

      what is the end-end throughput?

      What is average end-end throughput? -> Rc

      Look at scenario 2 and 3
