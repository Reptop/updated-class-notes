Jan 26th:
  1. An object in motion (or at rest) stays in motion (or at rest) unless a net external force acts on it
  2. The net force on an object is equal to the objects's mass times its acceleration
  3. If A exerts a Force on B, then B exerts a force of the same magnitudeon A in the opposite direction

  F = MA

  If there is an acceleration, there must be a net force 

  summnation of forces != 0

  equalibrium: the summnation of forces = forces
  Two types: Static: nothing is moving
             Dynamics: not accelerating but it is moving (constant velocity thats not 0) 

  Dynamic equalibrium:
    acceleration != 0 (when something's accelerating)

  Friction:
    If something is sliding to the right, the friction vector will point to the left
    
    Friction is an opposing force
    
    Force on the stone by the rope: Tension force 

    Force on the stone by earth: gravity

    Force on the box by rope: Tension

    Force on the box by earth: Gravity

    Normal force: orthogonal force from myself 

    When two things are pushed together, there is a normal force that pushes back

    Not everything needs to have a normal force

    The normal isnt always equal to the force of gravity - it can be greater sometimes

    How to draw a good FBD:
      1. Include coordinates (where is the x direction, y direction, and origin)
      2. Represent the object as a single point (for now)
      3. Draw each force acting on the object
        - Label the forces
        - Draw them to scale (if possible)

      Doing thrse things will make the next steps of the problem go much smoother. You should always draw 
      Free body diagrams for forces problems, and we will always must draw one
