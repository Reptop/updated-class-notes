Things to Study:

  Chapter 1:
    Describe the difference between health and wellness.
      - Health is about the overall condition of the body and the presence or absence of disease. wellness is an umbrella term to describe 
        the quality and vitality of the body and mind

    Examine the 8 dimensions of wellness and give examples of each dimension.
      - Physical
          Maintaining a healthy body and seeking care when needed
      - emotional 
          Coping effectively with stress and your feelings
      - occupational
          Job satisfaction
      - environmental
          balance between yourself and the envioronment
      - spiritual
          Seeking meaning and purposes 
      - social
          connecting with others in a meaningful way 
      - intellectual 
          Crtitically thinking about new ideas 
      - financial 
          Living with your means 

    Explain the 7 steps for implementing behavior change.
      - Where am I right now when it comes to my goal? Why do I want to change? pros and cons of changing? What is my motivation? barriers? strategies?

    Sequence the Transtheoretical model (TTM)’s Stages of Change and give examples for each stage.
      - pre-contemplation,
         Not even thinking of making a change 
      - contemplation
         Starting to think about change but not prepared to take action
      - prepartion
         small changes are being made, but not consistent 
      - action
          Consistent changes are being made for less than 6 months 
      - maintenence
        Consistent changes are being made for more than 6 months

    Identify the 4 ways we can build self-efficacy.
      - Mastery
        - Practice makes perfect and overall confidence in our abillities
      - Vicarious experience
        - being with people with the same goals as you
      - verbal persuation
        - Recieving specific feedback on how to improve
      - emotional arousal
        - feeling a sense of accomplishment, like in a competition for instance

    Practice using SMART goals to set a personal goal.
    S: specific
    M: Measureable
    A: action
    R: realistic
    T: Time oriented

    Describe 3 or 4 strategies for implementing behavior change.

    Describe the components of the energy balance equation.
      - Energy in: Need a certain number of calories for a balance in energy in and energy out. A balance is generally based on biological sex, age, and activity levels.
                the body adapts if we under or over consume

    Identify different aspects that influence one’s Basal Metabolic Rate.
      - A BMR is the minimum amount of energy required to keep your body functioning
        Factors that INCREASE BMR: 
          - Higher lean muscle mass
          - Taller
          - Younger age
          - Elevated Thyroid levels
          - stress
          - male 
          - Pregenancy or lactation
          - Certain drugs

        - Factors that DECREASE BMR
          - Lower lean muscle mass
          - shorter
          - older age
          - lower thyroid levels
          - starvation or fasting
          - female

    State the total percent of energy output for each component.
      Food digestion: Thermic effect of food (TEF) -> # of calories needed for digestion process. uses 5-10% of one's total calories
                      protein takes more energy to digest: 20-30% of the total consumed calories, carbohydrates: 5-10%, fats 0-3%

                      eating a lot of protein doesnt mean you will burn more calories because TEF is stable.

    Recall which component of energy out is the most variable and explain why.
      Physical activity is the most variable, taking up 15-35% percent of total energy output per day depending on the activities we are doing.
      There are various physical acitivites we can do at different intensities
      (the more activity you do, the more calories you burn)

    Describe why dieting doesn’t work and what contributes to this.
     Your body reacts to diets as if you are starving. From an evolutionary standpoint the body's resistance to weightloss makes sense.

     Also, the body's setpoint is more likely to go up than down -> A setpoint is what your body thinks your weight should be
      Having healthy habits is more important than weight with regards to risk of death

    Explain how the number of health behaviors impact risk of death in comparison to body fat levels.
    Identify what body composition is measuring.
      proportion of fat free mass to fat mass
    Categorize the amounts or ranges for body fat for men and women.
    Describe the different methods of measuring body composition.
    Examine fat patterning distributions and how that relates to health risk.
    Differentiate the attributes of the three different body types.
    Explain the concept of body image and how it affects health behaviors.
    Identify the influences on positive and negative body image.
    Describe eating disturbances and eating disorders.
    Identify the different types of eating disorders and list at least one good source of information about eating disorders.
    Describe how you can support a friend or family member with an eating challenge or eating disorder.
    Explain strategies for positive body image.
      - Develop a healthy lifestyle: focus on quality foods and physical activity

      - Know that shape and size does not determine your worth

      - 
    Identify social movements that are being conducted to positively impact body image.
