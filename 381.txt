  - you can make groups to submit assignments.
  - this has to be setup before the first assignment 
    due date.
  - You are also stuck with this group 

  - this class is about the theory of programming langauges 

  - how can we define a PL? (programming langauge)

  - how can we study a PL?
  
  central concept in computer science:
  - algorithms 
  - abstractions

  big o --> the relationship between the runtime of an algorithm 
  and the change in input size of that algorithm


  Abstration levels:
  5: Meta langauge -> Regular expression....
  4: feature -> syntax, semantics 
  3: Model/paradigm -> lamda calculus, turing machine 
  2: Language -> Elm, C, c++ 
  1: Program -> fac n = if n == 1 then 1 else n*fac(n - 1) 

A langage to define the structure and meaning of another langauge 

Context free grammar?

  Metalangauge:
    - Grammars 
    - Elm 
    - English

our focus summary:
  - define abstract syntax and semantics 
  - compare different language features 

use Metalangauges for examining concetps:
  - definitions using grammars 
  - intepreters using Elm

what is elm?
  Elm is a functional programming langauge 
  - strongly and statically typed 
    - types are checked first before anything is run 
  - compiles to javascript 
  - langauge design focused on simplicity

  - we are trying to use elm as a Metalangauge 

    using elm is useful in creating the syntax for other langages...

  Tracing:
    ... this will be on the QUIZ!!


  April 9th 2024:
    De/Re constructive programming


    Lists:
      list constructers: 

      -- List constructors:
      --   [] : list a
      --
      --   a -> List a -> List a

  once again, nothing is mutable so you're making copies 
  of data structures


  replFst x l = case l of 


Notes for next quiz:
  - LOOK at the function arguments 
  - actually practice before the test 
  - dont get distracted the day before 


What is a language?
  A system of communication in a structured way 
    
  Natural langauge - used for arbitrary communication 
  complex, nuanced, inherently ambiguous 

  programming langauge:
    - used to descrube computation 
    - programs have structure and meaning

  two aspects of language:
    syntax: the strucure of its programs 
    semantics: the meaning of its programs 


  Grammar: set of productions (or rules)
  production: L ::=R 
  L = nonterminal symbol 
  R = sequence of terminal and nonterminal symbols 


  sentene sequence of terminal...
  langauge: set of derivable sentences 


  grammar is a four tuple where we have 
  nonterminal, terminal, set of productions, and a start symbol 

  derivitations are quite literally all possible sets 


  we're looking at a large abstraction of what a langauge is 
  holy fuck
