General principles of biochemical engineering:

Carbon cycle:
Is an example of a biogeochemical cycle

a biogeochemical cycle are the chemical reactions 

Carbon Footprint:
    The total set of greenhouse gas emissions cuased by an organization, event, or product.

    The carbon foorprint typically considers all six of the kyoto protocol greenhouse gasses. (What are kyoto protocol greenhouse gasses?)

    - Carbon dioxide
    - Methane
    - Nitrous oxide
    - Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)
    - Perfluorocarbons (PFCs)
    - Sulphur hexafluoride (SF6)

Carbon footprinting
    US Average Person 16tons of Co2 per year
    World average person 4 tons of Co2 per year

the world average is less than average US person is because many people around the world dont live in a highly industrulized society. 

Co2 and Global Warming:
    Carbon footprint allows for different greenhouse gases to be compared on a like-for-
like basis

Measuring Co2 in the atmosphere:
    Mauna Loa Observatory Carbon Dioxide Concentration increased to 410 parts per million (ppm) in 2020

Consequences of increasing CO2:
    the ph if areas in the ocean is decreasing, the acidity in the ocean causes erosions of shells, heavily incflicting damage to organisms
    with shells 

Materials contribution to CO2: 
    virgin aluminum contributes the higheset concentraion of co2 as a byproduct

What if we do nothing: 
    Global warming is dependant on all of the co2 in the atmosphere; we are projected to increase in global temp by at least 2C in the next 14
    years.
